# Hate Speech Classifier

### Warning: the contents of the data and project contain many offensive slurs, including but not limited to, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. offenses.

## I. Goal

              Hate speech, aggressive language, and cyberbullying on social platforms can make the experience of being digitally immersed very difficult.
              While the argument of having the freedom of speech continually persist, the lines between true freedom and offensiveness become blurred.
              Freedom of speech can easily be warped into offensive, hateful, and unconstructive words online, particularly towards people who belong to
              marginalized communities. Formally, hate speech can be defined as <i>abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses prejudice 
              against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation</i> (as defined by Oxford Languages).

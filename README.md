# Hate Speech Classifier

### Warning: the contents of the data and project contain many offensive slurs, including but not limited to, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. offenses.

## I. Goal

In order to get the most accurate results, it is important to differentiate between actual hate speech and speech that contains offensive language. There are important key qualitative features that are different amongst the abusive language documented. For instance, a song lyric that contains a curse word may not be considered the same way as a direct, racist slur.
